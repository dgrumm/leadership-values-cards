## Architecture Choices
- **Next.js over Vite**: Chosen for integrated API routes and better session management
- **@dnd-kit over react-beautiful-dnd**: Better performance and accessibility
- **Ably over raw WebSockets**: Managed service with presence, history, and reliability
- **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler for local state, Ably handles sync

## Design Patterns
- **Optimistic UI**: All drag operations update locally first, then sync
- **Throttling**: 50ms for cursor, 200ms for card positions
- **Session codes**: 6 uppercase alphanumeric (A-Z, 0-9)
- **Animations**: All use Framer Motion with specific timings from PRD

## Known Constraints
- Must support exactly 8 cards in Top 8, exactly 3 in Top 3
- No localStorage/sessionStorage in artifacts (memory only)
- Desktop-only: Optimized for 1920x1080
- 60-minute session timeout with 55-minute warning

## Testing Scenarios
- Solo flow: Login → Sort 40 cards → Top 8 → Top 3 → Export
- Multi-user: 5 users simultaneously sorting and revealing
- Constraint validation: Exceeding pile limits triggers bounce
- Network issues: Disconnection and reconnection handling

## Performance Targets
- Card drag at 60fps minimum
- Auto-cleanup timeouts to prevent memory leaks
- useCallback optimization for event handlers
