# Testing Requirements & Standards

## Mandatory Testing Policy

**CRITICAL**: All code changes MUST pass comprehensive testing before merge/deployment.

### Test Categories Required

#### 1. Unit Tests (Jest)
- **Location**: `/tests/unit/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:unit`
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Scope**: Components, hooks, utilities, stores

#### 2. Integration Tests (Jest)
- **Location**: `/tests/integration/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:unit` (included)
- **Scope**: API endpoints, form flows, data flow

#### 3. E2E Tests (Playwright)
- **Location**: `/tests/e2e/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:e2e`
- **Scope**: Complete user journeys, cross-browser compatibility

### Test-First Development

1. **Before Implementation**: Check existing tests that should pass
2. **During Implementation**: Run relevant test subset frequently
3. **After Implementation**: Full test suite must pass
4. **Before Commit**: Pre-commit hook runs critical tests
5. **Before PR**: All tests must pass

### Test Types by Feature Area

#### Core Flow Testing
- Login/session creation
- Step 1 (flip cards, drag to piles)
- Step 2 (select top 8, constraints)
- Step 3 (select top 3, final arrange)
- Export functionality

#### Interaction Testing
- Drag-drop mechanics with animations
- Pile constraint enforcement (8-card limit)
- Card flip animations and timing
- Touch/mobile gesture support

#### Collaboration Testing (Future)
- Multi-user real-time sync
- Presence indicators
- Reveal mechanisms
- Session management

#### Visual Regression Testing
- UI consistency across browsers
- Animation smoothness
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Theme consistency

### Agent Usage for Testing

#### test-runner Agent
- **Use When**: Tests failing after implementation
- **Purpose**: Analyze failures, fix implementation (not tests)
- **Scope**: E2E test debugging, multi-user scenarios

#### code-reviewer Agent  
- **Use When**: Before PR submission
- **Purpose**: Review test coverage, test quality
- **Scope**: Test architecture, missing test cases

### Test Environment Setup

#### Local Development
```bash
# Start dev server with test data
npm run dev

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E with UI for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

#### CI/CD Requirements
- All unit tests must pass
- All E2E tests must pass  
- Coverage threshold: 80%
- No test skips (`test.skip`) allowed
- No debug-only tests (`test.only`) allowed

### Test Data Management

#### Development Data
- Use `/data/csv/development.csv` for consistent test scenarios
- Isolated test sessions with unique codes
- Mock external dependencies (Ably, exports)

#### Test Fixtures
- Page object models in `/tests/e2e/page-objects/`
- Shared test utilities in `/tests/e2e/utils/`
- Reusable test data in `/tests/e2e/fixtures/`

### Debugging Failed Tests

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Analyze Error**: Read full error message and stack trace
2. **Identify Root Cause**: Implementation bug vs. timing issue
3. **Fix Implementation**: Never modify tests to make them pass
4. **Verify Fix**: Re-run specific failing test
5. **Full Suite**: Run complete test suite to check regressions

#### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Timing Issues**: Use proper `waitFor` conditions, not timeouts
- **Animation Conflicts**: Ensure animations complete before assertions
- **State Management**: Clear state between tests
- **Network Issues**: Mock external calls, use test data

### Test Performance Standards

#### Acceptable Execution Times
- Unit tests: <5 seconds total
- Integration tests: <30 seconds total  
- E2E tests: <2 minutes per spec
- Full test suite: <5 minutes total

#### Optimization Techniques
- Parallel test execution where safe
- Shared browser contexts for E2E
- Efficient test data setup/teardown
- Smart test ordering (fast tests first)

### Specification Testing

#### Requirement Traceability
- Each spec acceptance criteria â†’ test case
- Critical paths must have E2E coverage
- Edge cases must have unit test coverage
- Error scenarios must be tested

#### Test Documentation in Specs
```markdown
## Test Cases
### AC1: User can flip cards one at a time
- **Unit Test**: `Card.test.ts` - flip animation triggers
- **E2E Test**: `drag-drop-step1.spec.ts` - full flip sequence
- **Expected**: Card reveals value, updates count, prevents double-flip
```

### Quality Gates

#### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Review existing relevant tests
- [ ] Identify test gaps for new feature
- [ ] Plan test coverage approach

#### Implementation
- [ ] Unit tests pass continuously
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] Error handling tested

#### Pre-Commit
- [ ] Full unit test suite passes
- [ ] Critical E2E tests pass
- [ ] No test skips or focus-only tests
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean

#### Pre-Merge
- [ ] All tests pass in clean environment
- [ ] Test coverage meets threshold
- [ ] No flaky tests identified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained

**Remember**: Tests are not obstacles - they're confidence builders. Good tests catch bugs early and enable fearless refactoring.
