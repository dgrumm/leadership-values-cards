# ADR-002: Multi-User Synchronization Architecture Assessment and Improvement Strategy

**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  
**Technical Story**: Comprehensive architectural assessment of real-time collaborative card sorting system

## Context

The Leadership Values Card Sort application is a multi-user collaborative system that has undergone significant architecture development to address state management and real-time synchronization challenges. This ADR provides a comprehensive assessment of the current architecture and identifies critical areas for improvement.

### Current State Analysis

**Architecture Foundation:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Dual-layer approach with Zustand (local) + Ably (real-time sync)  
- **Real-time**: Ably WebSockets with presence channels, reveals, and viewers
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit/sortable for card interactions

**Recent Improvements Implemented:**
- Session-scoped store architecture (SessionStoreManager) ‚úÖ Complete
- State isolation between participants ‚úÖ Complete  
- Participant state consistency fixes ‚úÖ Complete
- Event-driven presence management ‚úÖ Complete

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. **Architectural Fragmentation - HIGH SEVERITY**

**Analysis**: The codebase shows evidence of inconsistent architectural patterns across different subsystems:

```typescript
// INCONSISTENT STATE ACCESS PATTERNS
// Some components use session-scoped stores:
const store = useSessionStep1Store(); // ‚úÖ Correct pattern

// Others still reference global stores directly:
export const useStep1Store = create<Step1State>(...); // ‚ùå Legacy pattern
```

**Impact**: 
- Mixed patterns make the codebase difficult to understand and maintain
- Risk of regression to global store usage without proper enforcement
- Developer confusion about which pattern to use

#### 2. **Real-Time Synchronization Complexity - MEDIUM SEVERITY** 

**Evidence**: Specifications indicate unimplemented features:
- Real-time sync spec (04.2.3) shows status "üî¥ Not Started"
- Complex participant channel management architecture designed but not fully implemented
- Dual state systems (local + shared) lack clear coordination protocols

**Current Gap**: 
```typescript
// Specified but not implemented:
class ParticipantsChannelService {
  // Complex channel management for join/leave events
  // Status update broadcasting
  // Conflict resolution mechanisms
}
```

#### 3. **Testing Architecture Gaps - MEDIUM SEVERITY**

**Analysis**: While specifications mention comprehensive testing:
- 345+ tests exist but production bugs still occur in synchronization
- Test architecture doesn't adequately cover multi-user edge cases
- No systematic chaos engineering or property-based testing for distributed scenarios

#### 4. **Performance Optimization Needs - MEDIUM SEVERITY**

**Current Patterns**:
- Cursor updates: 50ms throttling
- Card moves: 200ms debouncing  
- Real-time updates via polling with 2-second intervals (partially resolved)

**Issue**: No systematic performance monitoring or optimization for scaling beyond small groups

## Requirements for Improved Architecture

### Functional Requirements
- **Complete State Isolation**: Zero cross-participant state bleeding
- **Real-Time Reliability**: <100ms propagation for shared state changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Predictable handling of concurrent operations
- **Session Scalability**: Support 10+ participants per session with 50+ concurrent sessions
- **Offline Resilience**: Graceful degradation and recovery from network issues

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Maintainability**: Clear architectural patterns consistently applied
- **Performance**: No degradation in single-user responsiveness
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of multi-user scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into sync performance and reliability

## Decision

Implement a **Progressive Architecture Consolidation Strategy** that builds on existing session-scoped infrastructure while addressing identified gaps.

### Chosen Solution: Three-Phase Architectural Consolidation

**Core Principle**: Maintain existing functionality while systematically improving architecture consistency and reliability.

**Architecture Layers**:
1. **Participant-Isolated Local State** (Zustand + SessionStoreManager)
2. **Session-Shared Coordination State** (Ably + Event Sourcing)
3. **Monitoring & Resilience Layer** (Performance tracking + Error recovery)

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Complete Architecture Rewrite
**Description**: Start from scratch with modern collaboration frameworks (Yjs, ShareJS)
**Pros**: 
- Industry-standard CRDT conflict resolution
- Built-in offline support
- Strong consistency guarantees
**Cons**:
- High risk of introducing regressions
- Significant development time (3-6 months)
- Over-engineering for current scale (2-6 users typically)
**Complexity**: Very High
**Risk**: Very High

### Option 2: Minimal Fixes Only  
**Description**: Address only critical bugs without architectural improvements
**Pros**:
- Low implementation risk
- Fast to implement
- Minimal code changes
**Cons**:
- Technical debt accumulation
- Doesn't address architectural inconsistency
- Limited scalability improvements
**Complexity**: Low  
**Risk**: Medium (debt accumulation)

### Option 3: Progressive Architecture Consolidation (CHOSEN)
**Description**: Systematic improvement of existing architecture with incremental validation
**Pros**:
- Builds on proven SessionStoreManager foundation
- Addresses all identified issues systematically  
- Allows validation at each step
- Maintains existing functionality
- Creates clear migration path for future improvements
**Cons**:
- Requires disciplined implementation approach
- Multiple phases may extend timeline
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low
