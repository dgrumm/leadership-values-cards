```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│        Header              │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  [More Imp]  [Less Imp]    │
│                            │
│                            │  
│  [Deck]      [Staging]     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Specified Layout (Not Implemented):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Header                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    [More Important] │
│ [Deck] [Staging]                   │
│                    [Less Important] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
