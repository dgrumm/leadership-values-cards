## Review Checklist

### Performance
- [ ] Drag operations maintain 60fps
- [ ] Animations use CSS transforms, not position
- [ ] WebSocket messages are throttled/debounced
- [ ] Images/assets are optimized
- [ ] React components properly memoized

### Security
- [ ] Session codes are cryptographically random
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] XSS prevention in card descriptions
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Code Quality
- [ ] Components under 150 lines
- [ ] Hooks extract complex logic
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
- [ ] Error boundaries for critical paths
- [ ] Loading and error states handled

### Collaboration Patterns
- [ ] Optimistic updates with rollback
- [ ] Proper cleanup of Ably subscriptions
- [ ] Conflict resolution documented

## Common Issues to Flag
