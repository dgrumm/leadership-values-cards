# Behavior:
# 1) Derive <slug> from the spec FILENAME (no extension):
#    - lowercase; spaces â†’ '-', remove punctuation .:,\'"/()&+
# 2) Branch: feature/<slug> from main (append -YYYYMMDD if it exists)
# 3) Print: active branch, file tree plan, test matrix, open questions. STOP (no file writes).

If no spec path provided, ask for it and validate it exists.

git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/<slug> || git checkout -b feature/<slug>-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```
