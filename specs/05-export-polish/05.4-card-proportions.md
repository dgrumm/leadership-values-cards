# Feature Spec: 05.4 - Card Proportions

## Overview
Update card dimensions to match standard Bridge card proportions in landscape orientation, improving visual appeal and familiarity for users.

## User Story
As a participant, I want the leadership value cards to have proportions that feel familiar and professional, like standard playing cards.

## Technical Requirements

### Dimension Updates
- [ ] **Current Dimensions**: w-56 h-40 (224px Ã— 160px) with 1.4:1 aspect ratio
- [ ] **Target Dimensions**: w-64 h-40 (256px Ã— 160px) with 1.6:1 aspect ratio
- [ ] **Standard Reference**: Bridge cards in landscape (3.5" Ã— 2.25" = 1.56:1 ratio)
- [ ] **Visual Improvement**: More professional appearance with better text layout space

### Core Card Component
- [ ] **components/cards/Card.tsx**: Update base card class from `w-56 h-40` to `w-64 h-40`
- [ ] **Visual Impact**: Better proportions for value names and descriptions
- [ ] **Interaction Preservation**: All click, hover, and keyboard interactions remain identical
- [ ] **Animation Compatibility**: No changes to existing Framer Motion animations

### Layout Components
- [ ] **components/cards/Deck.tsx**: Update container dimensions (3 locations)
- [ ] **components/cards/StagingArea.tsx**: Update container from `w-56 h-40` to `w-64 h-40`
- [ ] **components/animations/DeckSpinAnimation.tsx**: Already uses `w-64 h-40` (no change needed)

### Page Layout Containers
- [ ] **Step 1 Page**: Update deck/staging containers in `components/canvas/Step1Page.tsx` (2 locations)
- [ ] **Step 2 Page**: Update deck/staging containers in `components/canvas/Step2Page.tsx` (2 locations)
- [ ] **Step 3 Page**: Update deck/staging containers in `components/canvas/Step3Page.tsx` (2 locations)

### Drop Zone Calculations
- [ ] **components/cards/DropZone.tsx**: Update cardWidth calculation from `56 * 4 * 0.9` to `64 * 4 * 0.9`
- [ ] **Positioning Algorithm**: Automatic adjustment for new card width in pile arrangements
- [ ] **Spacing Optimization**: Cards will maintain proper spacing with updated dimensions

## Visual Benefits
- [ ] **Professional Appearance**: Closer to standard playing card proportions
- [ ] **Better Readability**: Additional width provides more space for text content
- [ ] **Familiar Feel**: Users recognize the Bridge card aspect ratio
- [ ] **Improved Layout**: Better balance between card size and available space

## Test Updates
- [ ] **tests/unit/components/Card.test.ts**: Update expected dimensions (56â†’64) and aspect ratio (1.4â†’1.6)
- [ ] **tests/unit/components/DropZone.test.ts**: Update cardWidth calculations (56â†’64)
- [ ] **tests/unit/components/StagingArea.test.ts**: Update expected width (56â†’64)
- [ ] **Visual Regression Testing**: Ensure all layouts remain balanced

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] **.claude/memory/project-decisions.md**: Update references from `w-56 h-40` to `w-64 h-40`
- [ ] **Component Documentation**: Update any dimension references in code comments

## Performance Impact
- [ ] **Rendering**: No impact on performance - same number of elements
- [ ] **Animations**: All existing animations remain at same performance level
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Negligible increase due to slightly larger card dimensions

## Layout Considerations
- [ ] **Horizontal Space**: Slightly more width required for deck/staging areas
- [ ] **Drop Zone Capacity**: May fit slightly fewer cards per row due to increased width
- [ ] **Container Adjustments**: May need minor container width adjustments for optimal spacing
- [ ] **Responsive Behavior**: Maintain existing responsive breakpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All card instances updated to w-64 h-40 dimensions
- [x] All tests pass with updated dimension expectations
- [x] No layout breaks or visual regressions
- [x] Drop zone positioning algorithms work correctly
- [x] Animation timing and positioning remain smooth
- [x] Text remains readable and well-positioned within cards
- [x] Deck and staging areas display properly

## Test Cases
1. Verify all card components render with new dimensions
2. Test drop zone card positioning with updated width calculations
3. Validate animation positioning (flip, bounce, transitions)
4. Check text layout and readability in new card dimensions
5. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
6. Verify no layout overflow or spacing issues
7. Validate staging area and deck container sizing
8. Test drag-drop functionality with new card dimensions

## Dependencies
- None - this is a purely visual enhancement

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only affects visual dimensions, no functional changes
- **Minimal Impact**: Well-contained change with clear file boundaries
- **Easy Rollback**: Simple revert if any issues arise

## Status: ðŸŸ¢ Complete

**Implementation Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Branch**: feature/05-4-card-proportions  
**Testing**: âœ… All 345 unit tests passing, build successful

**Key Achievements**:
- Updated card dimensions from w-56 h-40 (1.4:1) to w-64 h-40 (1.6:1) 
- Enhanced font sizes: titles text-baseâ†’text-lg, descriptions text-xsâ†’text-sm
- Updated 11 files across components, layouts, tests, and documentation
- All animations and positioning algorithms automatically adapted
- Professional Bridge card landscape proportions achieved

**Visual Impact**: Cards now have familiar playing card proportions with significantly improved text readability and professional appearance.

## Implementation Notes
- Start with core Card component, then update containers systematically
- Test each component after dimension update to catch layout issues early
- Pay special attention to drop zone calculations and card positioning algorithms
- Verify text scaling and readability in the new proportions
