# ‚ô•Ô∏è Leadership Values Card Sort

An interactive card-sorting exercise for identifying core leadership values through progressive reduction (40‚Üí8‚Üí3 cards). Built with real-time collaboration features for team workshops and individual reflection.

## üéØ Overview

This application guides users through a structured values identification process:

1. **Step 1**: Sort value cards deck into "More Important" and "Less Important" piles
2. **Step 2**: Narrow down to your "Top 8" most important values
3. **Step 3**: Select your final "Top 3" core leadership values

Perfect for leadership development workshops, team building exercises, and personal reflection.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple participants can join sessions and see each other's progress
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive card sorting with smooth animations
- **Progressive Reduction**: Structured 3-step process for focused decision-making
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate PDF reports of final selections
- **Semi-Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet... but doesn't really work for mobile device form facctor
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## ü§ñ Development Acknowledgments

This project serves as both a functional leadership development tool and a **case study in agentic AI development practices**. It was built with extensive assistance from AI agents to evaluate and improve human-AI collaboration workflows.

### AI Development Tools Used:
- **[Augment Code](https://augmentcode.com/)**: Primary development assistant for architecture, implementation, and testing
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)**: Code review, documentation, and problem-solving support
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**: Code completion and suggestion assistance

### Agentic Development Artifacts:
The repository includes comprehensive supporting materials designed to guide AI agents through complex development tasks:

- **`.claude/` directory**: Agent context, workflows, and decision templates
- **`/specs/` directory**: Detailed project specifications and acceptance criteria
- **Project PRD**: Product requirements and architectural decisions
- **Multi-agent workflows**: Coordinated processes for testing, debugging, and feature development

### Research & Learning Objectives:
- Evaluate effectiveness of structured agent guidance materials
- Test multi-agent coordination for complex software projects
- Develop best practices for human-AI collaborative development
- Create reusable patterns for agentic development workflows

The combination of human creativity, structured specifications, and AI assistance enabled rapid prototyping, comprehensive testing, and robust implementation of complex features like real-time collaboration and drag-and-drop interactions.

*This project demonstrates that well-structured agent guidance can significantly accelerate development while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.*
